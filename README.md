# SimpleCove - An easy to use backup utility

This is a simple scheduled backup application that is capable of backing up one folder to some local directory or some FTP directory.
As of today:

1. FTP directory selection is limited to the top set of directories
2. Release may not publish properly.
3. Needs an installer project.
4. Could use some refactoring.
